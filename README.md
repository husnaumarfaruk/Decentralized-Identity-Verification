# Blockchain-Powered Decentralized Identity Verification System

A secure, privacy-preserving identity verification system for financial services built on blockchain technology. This system enables financial institutions to verify customer identities while maintaining data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.

## Features

- Self-sovereign identity management
- Multi-factor authentication
- Zero-knowledge proof verification
- Regulatory compliance (KYC/AML)
- Secure document storage and verification
- Cross-institutional identity sharing
- Audit trail and reporting

## Smart Contracts Architecture

### IdentityRegistry.sol
Core contract managing user identity records and verification status.
- Stores hashed identity documents
- Manages verification status
- Controls access permissions
- Handles identity claims and attestations

### VerifierRegistry.sol
Contract managing authorized identity verifiers and their credentials.
- Verifier registration and certification
- Reputation management
- Staking requirements
- Dispute resolution

### DocumentStorage.sol
Handles secure storage and access control for identity documents.
- IPFS integration
- Encrypted document storage
- Access control matrix
- Document versioning

### AccessControl.sol
Manages permissions and access rights across the system.
- Role-based access control
- Institution-level permissions
- User consent management
- Regulatory access provisions

## Technical Requirements

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Web3.js or Ethers.js
- IPFS node (optional)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/defi-identity

# Install dependencies
cd defi-identity
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage

### Deploying Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

### Identity Registration

```javascript
// Example identity registration
const identityRegistry = await IdentityRegistry.deployed();
await identityRegistry.registerIdentity(
    userAddress,
    identityHash,
    documentHashes,
    { from: verifierAddress }
);
```

### Verification Process

1. User submits identity documents
2. Documents are encrypted and stored on IPFS
3. Verifier checks documents and attestations
4. Identity status is updated on-chain
5. User receives verification credentials

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is stored off-chain with only hashes on-chain
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Regular security audits and updates
- Compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations
